<h1>Java Opportunities</h1>


</ul><h4><p>The page or area describing the opportunities presented by your chosen technology/topic.<p></h4>
<p>Opportunities have evolved drastically over the course of 2 decades. Multiple apps have been developed and issued that have made our lives easier and memories
much more enjoyable. Due to Java's simplicity, millions of developers nowadays are programming Java and are using Java as a teaching language. Java has remained
the foundation of learning computer programming and many expert programmers for years have utilized this strategy. Many lecturers have utilized this approach and
have also introduced a higher degree of freedom which inevitablly allows for more mistakes an individual experiences. This provides the beginner programmers with
and oppotunity to understand and evaluate the issue, which allow for better understanding of the platform. Java can also be used to transition into other platforms
such as C code, C++, C#, Phyton, Javascript, and many more. Java has been utilized in making revolutionary products such as products for the Final Frontier, Data Intensity, Applications and Gaming, Code of Honour, and Remapping
of the Genome. Java had become the first platform to ever be the reason for the expansion of human knowledge and resources. 5 products that are responsible for the final
frontier were created for space and plantery research, like the NASAâ€™s Mars Exploration Rover. Java was utilized prominently to solve problems which include vast amounts of data and computation. 4 products that are responsible for data intensity were created it can
provide a software framework that facilitates using a network of many computers. Java was heavily implemented for the development of games and applications. Minecraft was one of the most famous games ever made by Java, kids along with adults have
enjoyed this game thoroughly and has become a stepping stone for many games out there. Applications include VisibleTesla and SmartThings. VisibleTesla is created by Tesla
automobile enthusiast Joe Pasqua to control his Tesla Model S. This app can set up geofencing and notify for different emergencies of the car. SmartThings is an application
developed by Internet of Things. This application lets you control any home appliances such as; lights, locks, radios, coffee makers, A/C's, and home security systems. all
of this is done via a single or shared device. This company was bought for US $200 million by Samsung Electronics. Java was employed intensely for automating the parts of
computer development. 10 products that are responsible for Code of Honour were created for building, deploying, testing, facilitating continuous integration, and continuous
delivery. Java was heftly operated for the study of the genome and it has been the main source of 2 companies, BioJava and Integrated Genome Browser. These 2 companies are
responsible for being able to observe genomic data sets even from DNA microarrays. These 2 companies also have the dedicated and designated tools provided to be able to 
process the biological data.</p>
