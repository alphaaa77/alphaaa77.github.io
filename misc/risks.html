<h1>Java Risks</h1>


</ul><h4><p>The risks of using Java.<p></h4>

<p>Of course with all programming languages, there are risks involved when it comes to the language's security.
  As Oracle reported in 2020, Java is currently the number one programming language for developers and they also have approximately fifty one billion java virtual machines running worldwide. However, these extremely large figures come with consequences such as the increased vulnerability due to the popularity of the language. According to the CVE Details (n.d.) who track security vulnerabilities in various programming languages, there have been approximately 673 vulnerabilities that have been discovered since 2010 with 130 of them getting a danger score of ten out of ten. These dangerous vulnerabilities consisted mainly of attackers being able to “affect the confidentiality, integrity and availability.”. However, it seems as though the people working for Java have improved their security over time as vulnerabilities with a score of ten consisted only from 2012 to 2016. What is important though, is that the users are running the latest patched version released from the team at Java to protect themselves from these vulnerabilities; Although it seems that a large portion of its users do not do this.
  According to an article by Korolov (2015), 48 percent of Java users in the United States of America were not running the latest patched version at the time, which obviously leaves them vulnerable to the known exploits that are out there. Due to these users possibly not being informed or refusing to update their version of Java, it unfortunately decreases the security of the language even though it is not the fault of the people at Java.
  Although when comparing Java to other popular languages, it’s security seems to be on par with most; An article by Bocetta (2020) explains that a recent study was completed by WhiteSource who are a “open-source security and license-compliance platform.”. This study looked into how secure a variety of programming languages are and compared them to each other. When comparing the languages, there was an obvious outlier in the results as C was by far the most vulnerable programming language. But this should come as no surprise due to the age of C since it was developed and it basically being the backbone of all these new and improved languages. When looking at Java’s performance, it actually did pretty well even with all that was mentioned earlier as when it was compared to other popular programming languages such as Python and C++ as there was only a minor percentage difference between them. This pretty much highlights the fact that there is no perfect programming language out there, and even with newer languages having a lot less reported bugs and vulnerabilities, people believe this is just because they haven’t been found yet.

  Java can also be used through third party extensions to a browser to allow software to be executed and distributed within your browser (Jackson n.d.). Unfortunately for Java though, many experts believe it is best to not only disable Java extensions but to completely uninstall it. This is due to the number of people using web browsers and not understanding the possible risks that come with browsing different sites without updating all of their software. This leads to multiple reports of laptops and computers being infected with viruses that have been caused due to Java. With this in mind I believe Java will need to take action and think of a way to resolve this quickly otherwise it will possibly lead to more and more websites not using Java and opting for other languages which could ultimately leave Java’s presence on browsers in the past.
