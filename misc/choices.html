<h1>Technology Choices</h1>


</ul><h4><p>The page or area describing the choices available to us through or by your chosen technology/topic. When we talk about choices, it clearly puts an individual at a disposition of answering a question. Like the question does Levi Ackerman from Attack on Titan actually die or nah.<p></h4>
<p>The best feeling to a choice is when an individual comes up to you and asks a question. Questions like these are expressed via various way; some verbally, some orally, and etc.</p>
<p>Let me give you some examples of some Questions. Does Levi survive or does he meet his unfortunate defeat? Why is One Piece sooooo long? Why is MahiTahi a core paper for Bachelor of Computer and Information Science?</p>
<p>These questions may never be answered but for whoever is reading this website shall do the honours of completing these incomplete Questions</p>
<p>for me.</p>
