<h1>Java Choices</h1>


</ul><h4><p>There are many choices with which Java can branch out into, due to its high demand in the marketplace and its authentic design that is perfect for developing
a wide range of applications and programs.</p>
<p>These choices include, but are not limited to:</p>
<p>- AI and machine learning </p>
<p>- Blockchain </p>
<p>- Web services </p>
<p>- Mobile Technologies (Android or iOS) </p>
<p>- Games & Mobile Applications </p>
<p> What makes Java so popular, and what sets it apart from other programming languages? Well, one reason is its platform independence. 
This means that programs can run on several different types of computers, provided that those computers have Java Runtime Environment (JRE) installed, which means that a Java program can run on it. 
Because most types of computers are compatible with JRE, this makes Java a prevalent programming language to use among many other programming languages. Since Java has been around for a long time, a lot of companies and organisations have adapted to using Java to build their companies. Many banks, retailers, insurance companies and other types of organisations use Java. This goes to show that Java can be used in many ways, whether it be for retail, for commercial use or for casual use such as games or other types of programs and applications. A lot of Android applications are already being coded using Java, through Google’s Android API. Many fields of services, including government, healthcare, insurance, education and defense departments all have their applications built using Java. One significant example of this is Google mail, or G-Mail. Nowadays, Java is often the most used choice for scientific applications. 
One big example of this is the NASA’s Mars Exploration Rover. This amazing piece of technology was coding using Java. As explained before, Java is very versatile and can take a programmer on many different career paths, whether it be building and designing games, mobile applications, desktop applications or simple web applications. Java is capable of working in all of these environments, which makes it a very versatile and prevalent programming language to use in today’s ever-changing technological society. Learning Java can also translate into other programming languages, as you will be learning skills and knowledge such as syntax, ideas, patterns, tools, styles and idiosyncrasies that are readily transferable to other programming languages. 
One of the biggest advantages that Java has compared to other languages is availability of a vast community that is always willing and ready to share any information or knowledge that may be useful for other developers. This is done by connecting programmers through online forums, online groups and web seminars. This large community of Java programmers ranges from beginners, to experienced programmers that share their experiences they have had on the Java platform. Java is also known to have excellent tools to make organisations more productive. Java is best for developing any kind of enterprise web application in almost every industry, as stated before. 
The Java language is also ideal for latest technologies such as AI, cloud development and even applications that are based on augmented reality or virtual reality. This just goes to show how prevalent Java is, and what the wide uses of Java can be for technology in society in today’s world. Java is also used for very popular web applications that we use nowadays. This includes famous websites such as eBay, Amazon, Facebook, LinkedIn and many more. 
One other big reason behind why Java is one of the most popular programming languages in the world is the fact that it is budget friendly. This means that even as a small business owner or as a casual programmer looking to invest time into a certain project, they can take advantages of Java and learn to create very large-scale applications for their customers or for commercial use. Overall, Java is a very robust and versatile programming language that has near infinite possibilities for use in today’s ever-changing society filled with lots of technology. Java is a very user-friendly language, which makes it the perfect programming language to learn for users who would like to start their programming journey, or to get started on an application fit for use in a business environment or even for casual use like games or mobile applications. 
Now onto a list of the most popular Java applications and how these applications have impacted society. 
We have stated the list of reasons as to why Java is such a prevalent programming language in today’s world. Now we will look at the programs that have been built with Java and how they have impacted society today. The first program/application and quite literally, the most popular software used today is Google. Google was built using Java back in September 4, 1998. Since then, Google has become a worldwide search engine, powering almost every single community today, through their various applications such as google mail, google search, their cloud engine with google drive, and many more. Google has become one of the biggest companies today, rapidly expanding their company into other fields such as social media and even other pieces of technology like the Google Car or the Google Glasses. Both of these piece of technology never took off as a popular and high demand product, however it goes to show how far Google has come since their start back in 1998. 
Another very popular application that has come out of Java is Minecraft. Minecraft was a game developed back in 2011 by a person named Markus “Notch” Persson. This game was built on Java, initially a solo project developed my Markus himself, which eventually, over the years, would become a worldwide phenomenon, taking the internet and the gaming world by storm, making this game a household name. Since then, Minecraft has been an integral part of the gaming world, being one of top 3 most sold games in history. Minecraft has since then created a lot of memories, as well as careers for online content creators, giving them a platform to share with large audiences. One more example of a popular project that was built on Java is Android OS. Very similar to Google and the reason why a lot of Android’s features are partnered with Google is the fact that they co-exist under the same brand and the same programming language. 
Since Android’s first mobile release in 2008, Android has become one of the leading mobile OS systems, only falling behind iOS, Apple’s operating system used in their mobile devices. Android is features in many phones that go under different brands, such as Samsung, Huawei, ASUS and many others. Android has impacted society greatly, as a much more affordable alternative to it’s rival, iOS iPhone.</p>
<br>
<p> To conclude, Java will remain one of the most used programming languages in the world. This is due to its versatility, its simplicity and overall the reputation it has developed as one of best and easiest to understand programming languages in the world. 
The possibilities with Java are near endless and what we are seeing now is just the start of it. 
There will be many more applications or features that Java will be the basis of, with only this being the start of it.</p>
