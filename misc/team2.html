<h2>Ethical issues relating to the technology, your personal reflections and recommendations </h2>

<p><em>Java is a very prevalent amongst programmers and is heavily utilized to teach beginner programmers. Java seems like a very fun lanuage 
to learn as it is the source of many successful projects out there like SmartThigs, aquired by Smasung, and Minecraft, that still has updates 
releasing as well as new packages that make the game more enjoyable. The only threat Java poses is for ulterior motives, anyone with ulterior
intentions could create hazardous software like viruses and applications. Although, Java has is a magnificent ability to possess, it is always 
hanging on the edge of a knife to either exemplary feats or detrimental consequences. This suggests that Java is not a bad programming language
if it were to fall into bad hands, the outcomes could be disastrous and if it were to fall into good hands, the outcomes would be promising.</em></p><br>
