<h2>Ethical issues relating to the technology, your personal reflections and recommendations </h2>

<p>I personally think that as a beginner programmer and someone who loves games and applications, Java is a 
very prevalent language among the many programming languages that exist in the field of programming. The only ethical issue that may come up regarding
Java is how people could decide to use it, or what they could make out of it. Because programming is a very versatile skill to have, it also means
that there are a lot of opportunities for malicious intent. This could be things such as dodgy applications, malware or even viruses. Aside from this,
Java also creates lots of good opportunities, so the malicious intent will only lie within the user and not within Java itself.
In conclusion, as a beginner programmer, I would definitely recommend this programming language as a good entry level language to start with,
with the knowledge you gain from it being readily transferable to other programming languages.</p>
