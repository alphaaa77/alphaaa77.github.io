<h2>Ethical issues relating to the technology, your personal reflections and recommendations </h2>

<p>I personally believe that learning a new coding language will always be beneficial, 
  so I would definitely recommend learning a coding language especially one that is as popular as Java. This will not only allow you to make programs 
  like the popular ones out there that use Java, but it will also allow you to pick up other 
  languages easier and faster due to there being some similarites.
  From an ethical standpoint, the main issue is obviously creating software/viruses or finding vulnerabilities
  within Java with harmful intentions. Unfortunately this is only reliant on the person who is
  doing these actions and the only thing Java can really do to help deal with this is to continue 
  improving their security.
