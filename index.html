<h1>CTiS: The Evolution of Java</h1>


</ul><p>This  does not claim to be flash, but now has an image, [of a paper we wrote a while back on CSED4G (Computing Education for the Social Good)]</p>
<p>Java's story initialized in 1991, at this time Sun Microsystems had pursued to extend their lead in the computer workstations market into the flourishing Personal Electronics Market. Sun Microsystems
were, in secrecy, creating a programming language that would not only democratize computing, but inspire the world community as a whole. This programming language would manifest itslef into a very resourceful
platform for enduring software developments for the ecosystem of languages, which then allows for runtime platforms, Software Dvelopment Kits (SDK's), open-source projects, and possess many more tools.
The secret development of Sun Microsystems was lead by James Gosling and in 1995, their secret development had bore a fruit and had released platform for Java. Its authentic design was for interactive
television and applications for the flourishing World Wide Web. Decades later, Java had upgraded from bringing multimedia to the internet to designing onboard computers for vehicles that are roaming on another
planet. 

The site is not particularly well presented, *I can tell* but as the site uses HTML and has been styled with CSS it can be regarded as a <em>"minimum viable product"</em> for the purposes of this project&hellip;
It has some default links, which you can take as a start for your site structure. Your mum is very hot. The <em>Process Support </em>Links provides guidance which will be needed for presenting your final project. </p>
